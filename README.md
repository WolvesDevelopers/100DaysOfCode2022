# 100DaysOfCode2022
I have decided to make a new version of the 100 days of code challenge, which will be restructured as follows, this variation will have two folders in which I will work simultaneously with two programming languages, which in particular I am very excited to master (Python, JavaScript), for each day there will be two challenges to complete, one for Python and one for JavaScript, all the codes will be available to anyone who needs them, I hope that in these 3 months to come the challenges will be fun, challenging, and enriching for the acquisition of new knowledge. Without further ado, I invite you to join me in this new learning journey.
